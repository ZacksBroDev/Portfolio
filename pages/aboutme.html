      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p id="intro">A developer, racer, and lifelong learner. I bring the same focus and drive to coding as I do to the track and the rink. 
        Whether I'm building a web app, racing dirt bikes, playing hockey, or pushing limits in BMX, I'm always striving to grow, perform, 
        and create something meaningful. Welcome to my portfolio..</p>
      <div class="details" style="display:none;">
        <h2 class="toggle-btn">Dirt Bike</h2>
        <p class="toggle">I'm passionate, driven individual who's always looking for the next challenge, whether it's on the track, at the rink, or 
          behind the screen. My personality is a mix of creative problem-solving, competitive edge, and dedication to growth. I thrive in environments 
          where I can learn, adapt, and push my limits.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of my biggest passions is dirt bike riding and racing. I've been riding for years, and it's 
          more than just a sport for me—it's a lifestyle. The focus and mental clarity it takes to navigate tough terrain at high speeds has taught me how 
          to stay calm under pressure and make split-second decisions with confidence. Racing keeps me disciplined and goal-oriented, always pushing to beat 
          my last best time, whether I'm on the track or working toward professional milestones.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="details" style="display:none;">
        <h2 class="toggle-btn">Programming</h2>
        <p class="toggle">My love for programming grew from a curiosity about how things work under the surface. Over time, it became much more than a 
          hobby—it's now one of my strongest skills and biggest passions. I enjoy building things from the ground up, whether it's a clean and functional 
          website, a useful tool, or a full-stack application. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and I'm constantly looking to learn new technologies, 
          improve my workflow, and stay on the cutting edge of development practices.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Programming gives me a creative outlet that challenges both logic and design. It's incredibly satisfying to turn an idea into something real 
          and usable. I approach every project with attention to detail and a drive to deliver high-quality, well-thought-out solutions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="details" style="display:none;">
        <h2 class="toggle-btn">Hockey</h2>
        <p class="toggle">Hockey has played a huge role in shaping who I am. It's not just about the game—it's about the commitment, the grind, 
          and the teamwork. Playing hockey has taught me the value of communication, trust, and perseverance. Whether it's a high-pressure playoff or 
          a casual pickup game, I bring the same level of intensity and respect to the ice.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>The fast-paced nature of hockey mirrors the pace of life and work: things change quickly, and you have to adapt just as fast. That mindset 
          has helped me in both personal and professional situations, where staying agile and thinking on your feet is key.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="details" style="display:none;">
        <h2 class="toggle-btn">BMX</h2>
        <p class="toggle">In addition to dirt biking, I'm also passionate about BMX racing. It's a sport that's all about precision, control, and 
          rhythm. Racing on a BMX bike requires a different kind of focus than motocross—it's tighter, faster, and just as intense. The skills 
          I've developed in BMX, like balance, timing, and mental preparation, have sharpened my reflexes and improved my physical conditioning across 
          the board.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>BMX has also given me a strong appreciation for community and competition. Whether I'm training solo or racing with others, there's 
          always a sense of pushing boundaries and striving for better.</p>
